# Homework 2-2

### Persist data from Kafka to Cassandra
-----
- Install cassandra-driver by
  ```
  virtualenv env
  pip install cassandra-driver
  pip freeze > requirements.txt
  ```

- Create two identical terminals with proper pip packages one runs `data-producer.py` and another runs `data-storage.py`. Use `Postman` to send HTTP method using `POST` method. Be aware of that both `kafka consumer` and `cassandra session` can be closed properly due to the shutdown hook.

- Connect with Cassandra by
  ```
  ./cqlsh `docker-machine ip bigdata` 9042
  ```
  and execute
  ```
  USE stock;
  SELECT * FROM stock;
  ```
  shows
  ```
   stock_symbol | trade_time                      | trade_price

### Operations on Terraform
-----
- Install `Terraform` by
  ```
  brew install terraform
  ```
  and execute `terraform` shows
  ```
  Usage: terraform [--version] [--help] <command> [args]

The available commands for execution are listed below.
The most common, useful commands are shown first, followed by
less common or more advanced commands. If you're just getting
started with Terraform, stick with the common commands. For the
other commands, please read the help and docs before usage.

Common commands:
    apply              Builds or changes infrastructure
    destroy            Destroy Terraform-managed infrastructure
    fmt                Rewrites config files to canonical format
    get                Download and install modules for the configuration
    graph              Create a visual graph of Terraform resources
    import             Import existing infrastructure into Terraform
    init               Initializes Terraform configuration from a module
    output             Read an output from a state file
    plan               Generate and show an execution plan
    push               Upload this Terraform module to Atlas to run
    refresh            Update local state file against real resources
    remote             Configure remote state storage
    show               Inspect Terraform state or plan
    taint              Manually mark a resource for recreation
    untaint            Manually unmark a resource as tainted
    validate           Validates the Terraform files
    version            Prints the Terraform version

All other commands:
    state              Advanced state management
  ```

- Rather than the traditional software desinged as `process-oriented`, `Terraform` is designed as `status-oriented`, which means it checks the current status of AWS before take any actions.

- After specify an AWS instance as following
  ```
  resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  ami = "ami-0d729a60"
}
  ```
  and execute
  ```
  terraform plan
  ```
  shows
  ```
  Refreshing Terraform state in-memory prior to plan...
The refreshed state will be used to calculate this plan, but
will not be persisted to local or remote state storage.


The Terraform execution plan has been generated and is shown below.
Resources are shown in alphabetical order for quick scanning. Green resources
will be created (or destroyed and then created if an existing resource
exists), yellow resources are being changed in-place, and red resources
will be destroyed. Cyan entries are data sources to be read.

Note: You didn't specify an "-out" parameter to save this plan, so when
"apply" is called, Terraform can't guarantee this is what will execute.

- Destory instances on AWS are easy by
  ```
  terraform destroy

  ```
  Do you really want to destroy?
  Terraform will delete all your managed infrastructure.
  There is no undo. Only 'yes' will be accepted to confirm.

  Enter a value: yes

  note that terraform also destroyed the volumes in EBS, which is a great help.
