# Homework 2-2

### Persist data from Kafka to Cassandra
-----
- Install cassandra-driver by
  ```
  virtualenv env
  pip install cassandra-driver
  pip freeze > requirements.txt
  ```

- Create two identical terminals with proper pip packages one runs `data-producer.py` and another runs `data-storage.py`. Use `Postman` to send HTTP method using `POST` method. Be aware of that both `kafka consumer` and `cassandra session` can be closed properly due to the shutdown hook.

- Connect with Cassandra by
  ```
  ./cqlsh `docker-machine ip bigdata` 9042
  ```
  and execute
  ```
  USE stock;
  SELECT * FROM stock;
  ```
  shows
  ```
   stock_symbol | trade_time                      | trade_price
